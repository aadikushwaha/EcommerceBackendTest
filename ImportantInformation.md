Subject: Request to Retrieve Files & Reattempt Project Submission

Hi [Hiring Manager's Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to let you know that I had previously built a project we discussed. However, due to an unforeseen technical issue, I lost access to the files. Fortunately, I was able to retrieve some key files recently.

Though I’m missing a portion of the work, I deeply value the opportunity and would welcome the chance to complete the project again. If you could provide another opportunity, I’m confident I can restore and finalize the deliverable promptly and to a high standard.

Please let me know if that’s possible—I’d greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for your understanding.

Kind regards,
Aditya kushwaha
